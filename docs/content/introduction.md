<div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-12 text-center my-10">
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <img src="/vite.svg" alt="vite" class="w-16 h-16">
        <span class="font-bold mt-2">Vite</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <img src="/vitest.svg" alt="vitest" class="w-16 h-16">
        <span class="font-bold mt-2">Vitest</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <img src="/vue.svg" alt="vue" class="w-16 h-16">
        <span class="font-bold mt-2">Vue 3</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <img src="/naive-ui.svg" alt="naive-ui" class="w-16 h-16">
        <span class="font-bold mt-2">Naive UI</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-center">
        <img src="/tailwind.svg" alt="tailwind" class="w-16 h-16">
        <span class="font-bold mt-2">Tailwind CSS</span>
    </div>
</div>

With Galaxy Charts, you can develop visualizations locally in Vue, taking advantage of advanced tooling like hot-reloading for instant feedback, efficient bundling for optimized performance, and other modern features. This setup enables a streamlined and responsive development experience.

- **Automated Testing**: Test your visualization thoroughly in the local environment, ensuring itâ€™s fully functional and bug-free before deploying it to Galaxy.
- **Enhanced Development Workflow**: By integrating state-of-the-art development tools, Galaxy Charts provides an efficient workflow that reduces the time and effort needed to build or embed 3rd-party visualizations.
